In this program, we use the pandas library to read customer reviews from a CSV file and the TextBlob library to
perform sentiment analysis on each review. We classify the reviews as positive, neutral, or negative based on the 
sentiment polarity score and calculate the average sentiment score. Finally, we output the results.
This exercise demonstrates the use of the TextBlob library for sentiment analysis and the pandas library
for data manipulation, which are essential skills in real work environments.
